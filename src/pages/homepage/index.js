                Well done ! You have found the easter egg, you win the right to brag
                about it to the other teams that didnâ€™t find it. Write down the name of your
                team so the other teams can know you were here:
            </NormalText>
            <Form>
                <Input placeholder="Write your team name here" type="text"/>
